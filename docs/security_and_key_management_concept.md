# Security Considerations / Threads

In a system that handels private keys which are used to authenticate the identity of companies, great care is in order to secure any access to such keys. The purpouse of the wallet is void if an attacker can get access to the private key and impersonate the company.

Our system is build to be safe from the following attacks

- A malicious attacker gets access to the wallets database
- An attacker gets access to a legitimate users IDP Account (OAuth Access Token)
- An adversary is able to access the user's or key secrets

The system is build such that private keys never leave an encapsulated security module and only exist in decrypted form in the moment they must be used. This is an isolated system component without public facing interfaces. It might be exchanged for a hardware security module or otherwise be deployed in a secure computing environment in the future. For now this is implemented as an isolated service with its own database.  
The other part of the concept is that private keys cannot be used without the separate secrets (user, key, vault secret) which are physically separated. Even in case that an adversary is able to get hands on two of these secrets he will not be able to obtain or use the private keys. The default number of secrets is two (key + vault secret) with the option to add an arbitrary number of user controlled key secrets which can be shared or individual.

## Architecture Summary

### SSI Service

- Has a public API
- Connects to its own database
  - where it stores encrypted `Key Access Secrets`

### User Authentication

- Users connect to the `SSI Service`'s API
  - Authentication via OAuth/Oid
  - Can manage their own key access secrets
  - Users may or may not have the access secrets to certain DIDs or keys within a did
  - General role based access model mathcing OAuth/Oid roles

### Security Module

- Offers an internal API
- Connects to its own database
  - where it stores encrypted `Private Keys`
  - is unable to decrypt private keys by itself

### Service Communication

- The `SSI Service` is connected to the `Security Module` via the internal API

### Private Key Security

- Private Keys can only be used with at least 2 separate secrets
  - A `Security Module` specific `Security Module Client Secret`
  - The private key specific `Key Access Secret`
  - optional additional key secrets
    - an arbitrary number of different key secrets what allows mulit user confirmation for key operations

### Key Access Secret Encryption

- The `Key Access Secrets` are encrypted with
  - A `SSI Service` specific `SSI Service Client Secret`
  - An optional user specific `User Secret` to encrypt the key secrets
  - Multiple encrypted versions of the same `Key Access Secrets` may be stored, encrypted with different `User Secrets` for each user who has acces to this key

# Perspective

## Threat Model: Complete Network Traffic Compromise

In scenarios where an attacker gains complete control over network traffic (man-in-the-middle attacks, compromised network infrastructure, or state-level surveillance), traditional symmetric key-based (password) authentication becomes vulnerable. An attacker could intercept and replay the `Key Access Secrets`.

## Protection Strategy: Challenge-Response with Verifiable Presentations

The system implements a challenge-response protocol where users sign verifiable presentations containing their user secrets instead of transmitting just a password directly. This approach leverages the cryptographic strength of asymmetric signatures and the verifiable credentials framework to ensure authentication integrity even under complete network compromise.

## Ecosystem Integration

EECC provides a personal SSI Wallet that complements the company wallet architecture, creating a comprehensive self-sovereign identity ecosystem for both individual and organizational use cases.
