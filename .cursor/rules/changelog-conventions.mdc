# Changelog Conventions

**Always update the Changelog.md file to reflect any changes on this project**

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Make sure that new changes are always added to the top of the list!

Never change existing release sections. Always add to the top of the Unreleased section.

## Sections and Structure

### Unreleased Section

- Located at the top of the file after the title
- Format: `## [Unreleased]` followed by subsections for change types
- This is where all unreleased changes should be documented
- At release time, rename this section to the version number with date

Example structure:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New features

### Changed
- Changes in existing functionality

### Fixed
- Bug fixes
```

### Release Sections

- Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- Use ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Latest version comes first
- Each release should be linkable

## Entry Categories

Use these standardized categories as subsections (### heading level):

- **Added** - New features
- **Changed** - Changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** - Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** - Now removed features
- **Fixed** - Any bug fixes
- **Security** - In case of vulnerabilities

Note on Semantic Versioning:
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes (Removed, Changed with breaking behavior)
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features (Added, Deprecated)
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes (Fixed, Security)

## Entry Guidelines

- Start each entry with a dash `-`
- Group related changes together using indentation for sub-items
- Use backticks for code references: `` `methodName` ``
- Be specific about what changed
- Write for humans, not machines

Examples:
```markdown
### Added
- Support for custom model providers via `@registry.register()` decorator
  - EECC API provider with Claude Sonnet models
  - Configuration via `.env` file

### Changed
- Updated `extract()` function to accept `model_id` parameter
- Improved error messages for failed schema validation

### Fixed
- Fixed memory leak in long document processing
- Corrected EPC URN format validation for SGTIN identifiers
```

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Don't just say "fixed bugs", explain what was fixed
- **For API changes**: Document both old and new behavior
- **For breaking changes**: Mark them clearly and explain migration path
- **For deprecations**: Explain what replaces the deprecated feature
- **For security issues**: Mention CVE if applicable
- **Use consistent terminology**: Refer to features by their proper names
- **Keep it concise**: Each entry should be a single line when possible
- **Link to issues/PRs**: When relevant, reference GitHub issues or PRs

## Release Process

1. Move all items from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section
2. Add version number following Semantic Versioning
3. Add ISO 8601 release date
4. Create git tag matching the version
5. Start fresh `[Unreleased]` section for next changes
